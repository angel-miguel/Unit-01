            <h2>MotoGP</h2>
            <p>While I don't consume any of major league sports I 
                am a huge follower of MotoGP! I don't just watch on
                Sundays though, I watch the entire racing weekend. 
                From how the riders are feeling on FP1 to the final 
                interviews on race day. Who is my favorite rider you 
                ask? Well of course that is the one - the only - number
                46 - Valentino Rossi!

            <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
            <p>I'm not sure when my infatuation with bodybuilding began
                but I've been into it for as long as I can remember now.
                Maybe its the fact that I'm not the tallest or most muscular
                guy around but I'm just fascinated with what a human can do
                with and to their bodies with the level of dedication that 
                professional bodybuilders do. Who is my favorite bodybuilder?
                That question is a bit harder to answer than who is my 
                favorite MotoGP rider of all time because when it comes
                to bodybuilding there is so much to compare but I think
                that overall its the Austrian Oak - Arnold Schwarzenegger.
